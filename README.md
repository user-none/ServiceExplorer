Service Explorer
================

An Android app to list services.

All services and running services can be shown.
They can be filtered to search for specific services.
Detailed information about a service is available.

This app is particularly useful for debugging when
creating an app that provides an exported service.
This makes it easy to see if the service is properly
exported. It also provides information such as the
service name and package to help ensure an app
using the service is properly connecting.
